# STEEM PHP/Python API

This is a project I made that allows you to interact with the STEEM Blockchain by using PHP files which calls a Python script using the PHP exec() function

The Python files uses the `piston-lib` library. The library can be found here: [https://github.com/xeroc/piston-lib](https://github.com/xeroc/piston-lib)

Server-side, you'll need a web server, PHP, and Python 3.

I personally run this API at https://api.steem.place using apache2 and php7.0

If you run Ubuntu, you can run the following and get this up and running easily:
```
sudo apt-get install apache2 php7.0 python3 python3-pip
```

Also, be sure to follow the `piston-lib` instructions at its repo to get piston-lib up and running. Otherwise, the python files will not run.
